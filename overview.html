                <a href="https://www.sigarch.org/deep-learning-its-not-all-about-recognizing-cats-and-dogs" target="_blank">personalized recommendation</a> in order to enable next generation recommendation systems. Personalized
                recommendation is central to many Internet services we use on a daily basis including social media,
                search, video and movie streaming, and e-commerce platforms. My <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03109" target="_blank">analysis and characterization</a> of
                personalized recommendation services at-scale is the first to identify the unique challenges
                recommendation models pose to efficient data center deployment, opening exciting new computing systems
                and architecture research directions. Building on the characterization, my work accelerates
                recommendation systems through a diverse spectrum of solutions including <a href="http://vlsiarch.eecs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISCA_2020_Near_Memory_Acceleration__Ke_.pdf" target="_blank">novel near memory processing
                systems</a>, <a href="http://vlsiarch.eecs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DeepRecSys_Gupta_ISCA2020.pdf" target="_blank">inference schedulers</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08820" target="_blank">data center-scale specialized hardware</a>. Through my close
                collaboration with industry, our software solutions for optimizing recommendation have been deployed in
                production data centers, yielding significant performance and efficiency improvements at-scale.

               <b>Sustainability and Computing</b>: My research goes beyond improving performance and efficiency to
                investigate new techniques towards enabling environmentally sustainable computing. My research is the
                first to show that the carbon footprint of modern mobile devices and data-centers requires owes not only
                to operational energy consumption and but also (and in fact is dominated by) embodied carbon from
                hardware manufacturing (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02839" target="_blank">Chasing Carbon</a>). Building sustainable computer systems for the future requires
                us to fundamentally rethink research and development across the computing stack. My research has
                conducted in-depth studies understanding the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00364" target="_blank">challenges and opportunities for sustainable AI</a>, developed
                methods towards <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10036" target="_blank">24/7 carbon-aware data centers</a>, and built <a href="https://ugupta.com/files/Gupta_ISCA2022_ACT.pdf" target="_blank">architectural carbon aware modeling tools</a>.

                In the past my research has also investigated co-designing neural networks and specialized hardware for
                low-power and energy-efficient mobile AI including image classification and speech recognition.

                My work has been recognized as an IEEE MICRO Top Picks (2021) and IEEE MICRO Top Picks Honorable Mention
                (2020), as well as received best paper nominations at the Parallel Architectures and Compilation
                Techniques (PACT 2019) and Design Automation Conference (DAC 2018). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer
                Science at Harvard University.
