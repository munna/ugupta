                <p><b>Offered:</b> In conjunction with MICRO 2022</p>
                <p >
                A fundamental bottleneck to conducting sustainability aware
                hardware design space exploration and optimization is the lack
                of carbon accounting tools. To address this gap, here we
                propose a tutorial for ACT, the first-of-its-kind architectural
                carbon modeling tool. ACT enables computer architects to
                quantify the embodied carbon footprint of hardware during early
                design space exploration — allowing designers to consider
                carbon as a first-order optimization target alongside
                performance, power, and energy. In this tutorial, we aim to
                provide a holistic overview of the sustainability implications
                of modern computer systems at the datacenter and mobile scale
                (motivation for ACT), an overview of the proposed ACT
                methodology, hands on demonstration for how to use ACT, and
                hands on demonstration for how to extend ACT in new ways. We
                believe such a tutorial will build a strong foundation for
                researchers across computer architecture, circuits and VLSI,
                and systems, to incorporate carbon analyses in their research.
